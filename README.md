# ApacheFlink

Apache Flink is a new trend in the stream processing industry, its the next generation engine that provides real time streaming as well as batch processing. Unlike Spark its core engine is based on distributed streaming dataflows where as spark's core engine is built on RDD which are not stream based. Spark provides streaming at micro batch level which many consider major reasong behind many companies reinvesting in Flink. Flink also has less configuration options and handles memory management natively and completely elimintates OOM errors. This will be my quick start to try it and provide differences.
