# ApacheFlink

Apache Flink is a new trend in the stream processing industry, its the next generation engine that provides real time streaming as well as batch processing. Unlike Spark it handles data and processing at Stream rather than batch. Spark provides streaming at micro batch level which many consider major reasong behind many companies reinvesting in Flink. Flink also has less configuration options and handles memory management natively and completely elimintates OOM errors.
